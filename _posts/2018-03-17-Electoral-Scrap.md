# Problem statement
In this module we need to extract data from a pdf and store it to an excel


## Data
Go to this link and download the pdf file '1.pdf'
https://github.com/datasutram/datasutram.github.io/tree/master/JU/data


## Sample
In the same link you will find an excel file named 'Sample-Vikaspuri' to show you how to store the data in a structured format.  Disclaimer: the scraped data is from Vikaspuri in Delhi and the electoral roll is from Kolkata they will not match.


## Description:
You can either use python modules like pdfminer, pdfquery or use image processing to extract the data from electoral rolls and store it in a structured form. In this problem time is of the essence, due to the vast number of electoral rolls we are looking for the quickest algorithm.

## Basis of Judgement:
You will be judged on the basis of how fast your algorithm is compared to those presented by your peers and also on how clean your extracted data is.
