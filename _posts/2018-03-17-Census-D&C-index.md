### Problem statement
Demand representing market affluence and connectivity of a location gives an idea of the affluence of that location and its population/households. Determining which are such factors, their collection, and developing a mathematical model to inculcate the data to calculate the Demand Index and Connectivity Score as per points of a location.

### Step 1
Visit and investigate thoroughly all available data at
http://censusindia.gov.in/DigitalLibrary/Archive_home.aspx
Which are necessary? What is the granularity?

### Handy pointers
1. This problem is entirely introspective in nature. You might have to define certain parts of it yourself as sub-problems, keeping in mind the goal. Ask yourself why and how before making any assumptions and/or decisions.
2. Use visual representation tools to understand correlation between factors from time to time.
3. Think of only public resources for data collection.
4. Cleaning the data will be important.
5. Properly defining the Demand Index and the connectivity measure beforehand is important. The math will follow.
6. If using preset models, make sure they are validated, and applicable in your problem statement.
7. Take a sample area and start.
