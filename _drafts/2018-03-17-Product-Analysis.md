# Problem statement
In this module we are trying to find a relationship between the background of an individual (age, gender, economic affluence, community) and the products he buys from departmental stores on a daily basis.

## Data
Go to this link and download product_list.xlsx
https://github.com/datasutram/datasutram.github.io/tree/master/innovation_labs/JU/data/excel


## Sample
Our research shows that people in the age group of 15-30 have a propensity to buy packaged foods like coke, chips, namkeen, whereas people over 40 have a liking for puffed rice.  When we go by community Marwaris are the largest consumer of namkeens, whereas North Indians are the least.

## Description:
The excel file contains the names of categories and products sold in easy day stores.
We want to predict from the background of the guy what kind of product he may need so we can stock the store properly, you are asked to provide us with four abstracts on how age, gender, community and economic affluence plays a role in what an individual buys.  Also providing possible data sources that may be scraped to get a mapping between products and these features.  Start with the products that's in the product list once that's done  we need you to identify products that should be there but isn't.

##Basis of Judgement:
You will be judged on the basis of how concise and accurate your report is, we want to get an holistic idea of how, when and why do we need the products we need. We need you to be scientific in your approach, with proper explanations and data to back it up.
