# Road Map
##Welcome,
The Data Sutram team congratulates for coming this far. This is to familiarize you with how Data Sutram functions and how you can be a part of the team. We would be offering paid-internships and other goodies(training from Julia computing, certification for projects you have worked on, etc.) this summer once you pass this phase. We have uploaded a series of projects onto datasutram.github.io.
Go through all the projects choose the ones you want to work on (single or multiple) add the end  of every project there is a form fill it up from any one of them. Once you do that you will be emailed a Company ID (please keep it private). Each project has maximum points and a stipulated time attached to it. The points you score from a project depends on your solution and how quick you come up with it.
Through out the process of working for the project you will be guided by a member of the Data Sutram team, and a campus manager. Feel free to contact any of us with problems you may be facing.
###We would be offering part-time jobs/ internships for the top 25 candidates.
