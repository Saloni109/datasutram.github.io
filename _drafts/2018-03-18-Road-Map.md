# Road Map
##Welcome,
The Data Sutram team congratulates for coming this far. This is to familiarize you with how Data Sutram functions and how you can be a part of the team. We would be offering paid-internships and other goodies(training from Julia computing, certification for projects you have worked on, etc.) this summer once you pass this phase. We have uploaded a series of projects onto datasutram.github.io
Go through all the projects, choose the ones you want to work on (single or multiple) add the end  of every project there is a form, fill it up from under any one of them. Once you do that you will be emailed a Company ID (you are advised keep it private). Each project has maximum points and a stipulated time attached to it. The points you score from a project depends on two things- the accuracy of your solution, the time you take to come up with it.

Through out the process of working for the project you will be guided by a member of the Data Sutram team, and a campus manager. Feel free to contact any of us with problems you may be facing.
###We would be offering part-time jobs/ internships for the top 25 candidates who pass the trial phase.
###May the odds be ever in your favor.
##Regards,
##Data Sutram
