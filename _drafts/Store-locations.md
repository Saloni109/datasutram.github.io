### Problem statement
Find out latitude & longitude co-ordinates of stores of Berger Paints & Nerolac located in the state of Rajasthan.

### Step 1
Investigate the websites of the respective Paint Companies to check whether they have a store locator database. If they have, inspect and understand their HTML layout so that you can write a code to scrape the data and save it in a tabular form in Excel.

### Handy pointers
1. Study which method and packages you need in order to scrape.
2. Read about Requests, Selenium, BeautifulSoup(python packages) and learn where to use which.
3. Google API allows only 2000 requests per day for free, in case web scraping is out of the question.
