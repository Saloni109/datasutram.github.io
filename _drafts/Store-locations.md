### Problem statement
The aim of this problem is to find out coordinates of stores of Berger Paints and Nerolac located in the state of Rajasthan.

### Step 1
Investigate their websites to check whether they have a store locator database.

### Handy pointers
1. Study which method and packages you need in order to scrape.
2. Google API allows only 2000 requests per day for free, in case web scraping is out of the question.
